# Installation Guide
The first link in the submitted files contains a pre-built version of the game for the Windows platform. Windows is the tested and intended platform for the game to run on.
But if you desire to play this game on linux or Mac, simply go to the second link and download the project source code files and open it with a Unity Editor and build it yourself.


# Gameplay Instruction
Our trailer indicates that we desire the player to discover the game’s mechanics by themselves, since one of the main themes of this game is perseverance and determination. So the only thing you really need to know is WASD(or arrow key) to move the character, the gameplay will teach you about the rest of its mechanics.

But if you really are stuck or just simply want to know anyway. Here are the detailed explanation for each mechanics in-game.


Glitters: Essentially the experience points of the game. Each type of enemy drops a certain fixed amount of “Glitters”, that the players can use to spend and level up their characters whenever they’re resting at a Lightflame. The amount needed to level up increases with each level. However, whenever your character dies in the game world, you will lose all your gathered Glitters completely(not the level ups you already spent Glitters on however) and your character leaves a Glitter Recovery Item where he died. Now the player has a chance to recover those lost Glitters if they manage to reach the Recovery Item on the next respawn. If you fail to do that too, you lose those Glitters permanently.

Lightflames: The save points of this game. In Glitter, your character cannot die permanently. Instead, whenever your health reach zero. Your character respawns at the character’s LAST RESTED Lightflame. Whenever a character rests at a lightflame, all enemies are cleared from the game, and the character’s health replenishes, and then the character gets a respite from the dangers and can freely level up as they please.Characters cannot rest or level up at the same Lightflame twice in a row, so rest wisely.

Level Ups: Players can level up when resting at a lightflame. There are five choices for level ups for each level, players can level up their 3 different weapons(dragonBlade, crossbow, fireball magic), or the character’s basic stats(Health&Armor, Speed). Each level up will result in the enemies in the game become more aggressive and, well, more in numbers as well. So pick your level ups wisely.
